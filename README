rePWM is a simple script to build a PFM/PWM model from a dataset using a PWM/PFM seed. The PWM/PFM model is built by masking each position of the seed PWM in turn with a flat prior distribution to create an unbiased, 'multinomial' estimate of the PWM from the given data. See Figure 1b in "Jolma, Arttu, et al. "DNA-binding specificities of human transcription factors." Cell 152.1-2 (2013): 327-339." for a more detailed explanation.

rePWM uses MOODS to calculate motif matches, so MOODS should be installed and the script moods_dna.py added to the system path. Other than that, only a standard python installation is needed. Instructions on how to install MOODS can be found from https://github.com/jhkorhonen/MOODS .

Help on running rePWM can be found by typing

rePWM.py -h

assuming that the script is in your system path. This should print the following documentation:

usage: rePWM.py [-h] [--mtype {pwm,pfm}] [--p P] [--t T] [--B B]
                [--Bforce BFORCE] [--no-rc {yes,no}] [--batch {yes,no}]
                [--bg BG BG BG BG] [--ps PS] [--lo-bg LO_BG LO_BG LO_BG LO_BG]
                [--tmpdir TMPDIR] [--keeptmp {yes,no}] [--v {yes,no}]
                matrix seq [seq ...] outfile

positional arguments:
  matrix                The input position frequency matrix file (tab-
                        separeted).
  seq                   Full path to a Fasta-file containing sequences used to
                        recalculate the PFM.
  outfile               Full path to the output file (the recalculated PFM).

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --tmpdir TMPDIR       Directory used to store temporary files (masked
                        PFMs/PWMs, MOODS output files), default = ./
  --keeptmp {yes,no}    If yes, keep tmp files (default=no).
  --v {yes,no}          If yes (=default), print progress to screen.

Matrix file type::
  --mtype {pwm,pfm}     pwm or pfm (default=pfm).

Threshold selection (exactly one required)::
  --p P                 Compute threshold from p-value.
  --t T                 Use specified absolute threshold.
  --B B                 Return at least the specified amount of best matches.
  --Bforce BFORCE       Return EXACTLY the specified amount of best matches to
                        EACH of the masked motifs.

Search and model behaviour (optional)::
  --no-rc {yes,no}      If yes, disable matching versus the reverse complement
                        strand (default=no).
  --batch {yes,no}      If yes, do not recompute thresholds from p-values for
                        each sequence separately (recommended when dealing
                        with lots of short sequences, default=no).
  --bg BG BG BG BG      Background distribution for computing thresholds from
                        p-value with --batch (default is 0.25 for all
                        alleles).
  --ps PS               Specify pseudocount for log-odds conversion
                        (default=0.1).
  --lo-bg LO_BG LO_BG LO_BG LO_BG
                        Background distribution for log-odds conversion
                        (default is 0.25 for all alleles).
